We introduced DensRay debiasing on BERT. Our experiments
show that this method can effectively mitigate gender bias
in BERT on our constructed templates and WEAT. By checking
the perplexity on Wikitext-2 and the performers on GLUE
tasks, we also found this method causes little loss to the
model performance. We also extend this method to mBERT as
zero-shot debiasing for Chinese. As to further research, we
plan to explore the irregularity of the central point of the
gender dimension found in the experiments. In addition, this
method can also be extended to other linguistic features,
which will also be one of the future works.
